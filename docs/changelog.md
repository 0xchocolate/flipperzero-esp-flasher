Auto-reset and notifications! For supported boards (RTS and DTR connected), flasher will now automatically enter the bootloader and reset the board. Also added notifications for user feedback (blue LED for duration of flash, vibrate when done).


## v1.0

Initial ESP flasher release! Supports hardcoded addresses for bootloader, partition table, NVS, boot_app0, and firmware, with a toggle for ESP32-S3 (different bootloader address).
